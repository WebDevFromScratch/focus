# Focus

A script that's ultimate goal is to, after execution, take my machine into a state where productive work is achievable. Initial ideas for it:

- block access to distracting sites (configurable) _[WIP]_
- close distracting apps or set them to no-disturb mode
- turn on productive music
- should allow for the usage of flags to control desired behaviour (with configurable defaults)
